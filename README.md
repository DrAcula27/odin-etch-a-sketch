<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - JavaScript Basics - PROJECT: Etch-a-Sketch</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to continue to build on and cement my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project.</p>
<p>This project is a browser version of "something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch".</p>

<strong>After completing this project, I have accomplished:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Continued improvement of version control using Git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Understanding the DOM and how to manipulate it</li>
    <li>Continued improvement of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills</li>
</ul>
